- 👋 Hi, I’m David Omotayo
- 👀 I’m interested in front and backend web development with a knack for game dev, specifically indie dev.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript and although it's not as easy as i'd thought it would be , i'm slowly getting a hang of it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any frontend related project for now. Once i'm done learning some of the core essentials of the backend, i'm sure i wouldn't mind contributing in that field.
